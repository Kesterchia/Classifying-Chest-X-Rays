# About this project:

This project aims to train a neural network model to identify the presence of COVID-19 from images of Chest X-Rays. A model that works well would be useful for accelerating the identification of infected individuals, especially in countries where hospitals are overwhelmed and can benefit from streamlining the testing process.


## Dataset information:


The dataset was downloaded from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/praveengovi/coronahack-chest-xraydataset


## Content

The dataset contains ~5800 jpeg images of Chest X-Rays of Healthy patients, as well as patients affected with Pneumonia. The pneumonia X-Rays contain cases of bacterial infections as well as viral infections, such as SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome ) ,Streptococcus & ARDS (Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome).


## Acknowledgements

This analysis is made possible by the dataset compiled by Joseph Paul Cohen. Postdoctoral Fellow, Mila, University of Montreal.
